QPED - Quarterfall communication
==================

# General
The communication between Quarterfall and this plugin works exclusively by using a JSOn-object.
The JSON-Object should be named "qf.json" and is supposed to be in the root directory of this project.
When using Quarterfall to interface with his programme, the qf.json will automatically be generated for you.

# qf.json
Please find the needed properties in the table below.
Properties marked with a * will be automatically generated by Quarterfall and should only be manually written to if this programme is not used in conjunction with Quarterfall.
